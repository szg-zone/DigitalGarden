[{"content":"Hey there! Sharvin here again — and this time, I’m diving into something exciting!.\nToday marks the beginning of something I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to do for a long time — I’m officially starting my coding journey. I’m starting from absolute zero, with some little prior experience, but with full determination to learn, practice, and grow every single day.\n🎖 My initial goal is simple: I’ll begin with HTML and CSS — learning how websites are structured and styled — and then move on to JavaScript to add interactivity.\nThis won’t just be a passive learning experience. I’ve set a mindset to code daily, however small the effort may be. Along the way, I plan to take thorough notes, study how others write code, learn from open-source projects, and gradually start building my own projects from scratch.\n📁 Learning Git \u0026amp; GitHub: Building the Habit of Version Control Once I’m comfortable with the basics, I’ll dive deep into Git and GitHub — tools that every developer uses to manage and share their code. Learning these early will help me collaborate, contribute, and maintain my work properly from the start.\n🌐 Becoming Part of the Tech Community: Learn, Share, Grow More than just writing code, I want to be an active part of the tech community. I’ll ask questions, share what I learn, and keep improving with feedback and interaction. Whether it’s through blog posts like this one, social media updates, or contributions to open-source, I’m committing to showing up and staying consistent.\nThis journey is just beginning, but I’m excited for every line of code I’ll write, every bug I’ll fix, and every lesson I’ll learn. If you\u0026rsquo;re also learning, feel free to connect — let’s grow together.\n","permalink":"https://szg-zone.github.io/DigitalGarden/blogs/002-coding-journey/","summary":"📘 Starting My Coding Journey — From Zero","title":"📘 Starting My Coding Journey"},{"content":"Hello world! 👋 I\u0026rsquo;m Sharvin — I just completed 12th and have finalized my college. I\u0026rsquo;m all set to begin my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, and I\u0026rsquo;m super excited about everything I’m going to learn over the next few years!\nThis blog is my Digital Garden, where I’ll share what I’m learning, what I’m building, and how I’m growing. Whether it’s code, tech tips, personal wins, or even failures — everything is part of the journey.\n🌱 What you’ll find in this garden: My experiences as a CSE student The tech I’m learning (Python, C++, Web dev, and more) Projects I build — big or small Notes and learnings from topics like DSA, OS, DBMS, etc. Productivity hacks, study tips, and mindset reflections 🧠 No fixed schedule — I’ll post when I learn something worth sharing!\nI hope this becomes a helpful and inspiring space for others too — especially students like me starting out.\nThanks for visiting 🌸\nAnd maybe, I’ll visit your digital garden one day too 😄\nNotes Special thanks to Magdeline for her tutorial and explanation!\nMagdeline Huang\u0026rsquo;s digital garden About digital gardens How to set up your own digital garden Maggie Appleton's digital garden Tom Critchlow's digital garden Joel Hook's digital garden Colophon\nHugo PaperMod theme ","permalink":"https://szg-zone.github.io/DigitalGarden/blogs/001-my-digital-garden/","summary":"A bit about me and my garden","title":"🎯 My Digital Garden"},{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s about the journey, not the destination 🚗\nDone ✅ Create site (done 01/6/25)\n✅ Write and publish my first post (done 01/6/25)\n✅ Publish to GitHub and deploy to GitHub pages (done 01/6/25)\n✅ Add favicon (done 01/7/25)\n✅ Write and publish (done 04/7/25)\nTo-Do ⚪ Buy a domain and link it to my site\n⚪ Integrate Disqus comments\n⚪️ Add RSS feed\n⚪️ Add Google Analytics\n⚪️ Customise the header and footer (remove the background colour for share buttons)\n⚪️ Fix responsive layout (increase margins)\n⚪️ Create an About page\n⚪️ Create a Now page\n⚪️ Create a 404 page\n⚪️ Add \u0026ldquo;Last edited on\u0026rdquo;\n⚪️ Customise colour of code blocks\nFuture 🚀 Integrate https://webmention.io/ and https://web.hypothes.is/?\\\n🚀 Build a wiki\\\n🚀 Change stack to Next.js and MDX?\n","permalink":"https://szg-zone.github.io/DigitalGarden/changelog/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s about the journey, not the destination 🚗\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"done\"\u003eDone\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e✅ Create site (done 01/6/25)\u003cbr\u003e\n✅ Write and publish \u003ca href=\"https://szg-zone.github.io/DigitalGarden/blogs/001-my-digital-garden/\"\u003emy first post\u003c/a\u003e (done 01/6/25)\u003cbr\u003e\n✅ Publish to GitHub and deploy to GitHub pages (done 01/6/25)\u003cbr\u003e\n✅ Add favicon (done 01/7/25)\u003cbr\u003e\n✅ Write and publish (done 04/7/25)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"to-do\"\u003eTo-Do\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e⚪ Buy a domain and link it to my site\u003cbr\u003e\n⚪ Integrate Disqus comments\u003cbr\u003e\n⚪️ Add RSS feed\u003cbr\u003e\n⚪️ Add Google Analytics\u003cbr\u003e\n⚪️ Customise the header and footer (remove the background colour for share buttons)\u003cbr\u003e\n⚪️ Fix responsive layout (increase margins)\u003cbr\u003e\n⚪️ Create an About page\u003cbr\u003e\n⚪️ Create a \u003ca href=\"https://nownownow.com/about\"\u003eNow page\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n⚪️ Create a 404 page\u003cbr\u003e\n⚪️ Add \u0026ldquo;Last edited on\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr\u003e\n⚪️ Customise colour of code blocks\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Changelog"}]
