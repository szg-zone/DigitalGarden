# 🎯 My Digital Garden

This is my first ever digital garden aka dev blog! Check it out here 👉[link](https://szg-zone.github.io/DigitalGarden/)

This blog is my [**Digital Garden**](https://szg-zone.github.io/DigitalGarden/), where I’ll share what I’m learning, what I’m building, and how I’m growing. Whether it’s code, tech tips, personal wins, or even failures — everything is part of the journey.

Except rather than a blog, I'd like to think of this as my digital garden where I [#learninpublic](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) 📝

### 🌱 What you’ll find in this garden:

- My experiences as a CSE student
- The tech I’m learning (Python, C++, Web dev, and more)
- Projects I build — big or small
- Notes and learnings from topics like DSA, OS, DBMS, etc.
- Productivity hacks, study tips, and mindset reflections

> 🧠 No fixed schedule — I’ll post when I learn something worth sharing!
