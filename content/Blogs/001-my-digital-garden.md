## Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sharvin â€” I just completed 12th and have finalized my college. I'm all set to begin my B.Tech in **Computer Science and Engineering**, and I'm super excited about everything Iâ€™m going to learn over the next few years!

This blog is my **Digital Garden**, where Iâ€™ll share what Iâ€™m learning, what Iâ€™m building, and how Iâ€™m growing. Whether itâ€™s code, tech tips, personal wins, or even failures â€” everything is part of the journey.

---

### ðŸŒ± What youâ€™ll find in this garden:

- My experiences as a CSE student
- The tech Iâ€™m learning (Python, C++, Web dev, and more)
- Projects I build â€” big or small
- Notes and learnings from topics like DSA, OS, DBMS, etc.
- Productivity hacks, study tips, and mindset reflections

> ðŸ§  No fixed schedule â€” Iâ€™ll post when I learn something worth sharing!

---

I hope this becomes a helpful and inspiring space for others too â€” especially students like me starting out.

Thanks for visiting ðŸŒ¸

And maybe, Iâ€™ll visit your digital garden one day too ðŸ˜„
