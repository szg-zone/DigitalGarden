## Hey there!
 Sharvin here again — and this time, I’m diving into something exciting!.

Today marks the beginning of something I've been meaning to do for a long time — I’m officially starting my coding journey. I’m starting from absolute zero, with some little prior experience, but with full determination to learn, practice, and grow every single day. 

### 🎖 My initial goal is simple:
 I’ll begin with HTML and CSS — learning how websites are structured and styled — and then move on to JavaScript to add interactivity.

 This won’t just be a passive learning experience. I’ve set a mindset to code daily, however small the effort may be. Along the way, I plan to take thorough notes, study how others write code, learn from open-source projects, and gradually start building my own projects from scratch.

### 📁 Learning Git & GitHub: Building the Habit of Version Control
 Once I’m comfortable with the basics, I’ll dive deep into Git and GitHub — tools that every developer uses to manage and share their code. Learning these early will help me collaborate, contribute, and maintain my work properly from the start.

### 🌐 Becoming Part of the Tech Community: Learn, Share, Grow
 More than just writing code, I want to be an active part of the tech community. I’ll ask questions, share what I learn, and keep improving with feedback and interaction. Whether it’s through blog posts like this one, social media updates, or contributions to open-source, I’m committing to showing up and staying consistent.


This journey is just beginning, but I’m excited for every line of code I’ll write, every bug I’ll fix, and every lesson I’ll learn. If you're also learning, feel free to connect — let’s grow together.
