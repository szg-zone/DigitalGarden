This time, I want to share something that’s been one of the coolest experiences I’ve had in college so far — my journey with Panache, our university’s fashion and cultural club.\n🌟 Joining Panache When the club opened its Junior Core forms, I was beyond excited to apply. There were so many teams to choose from — choreography, makeup, management, and more — but I went straight for the Costume \u0026 Design Team.\nWhy? Because I’ve always been the creative type. I love crafting accessories, playing with designs, and visualizing outfits. The only catch? I had zero prior experience.\nStill, I knew I had to give it a shot.\n💡The Interview Day On the day of the interview, I was walking from my hostel to the interview room and suddenly thought — “Why not make a small design portfolio?”\nSo, right there on my phone, I quickly put together a mini portfolio showcasing some of my original designs, digital art, and sketches. It wasn’t fancy or long — but it was mine.\nWhen I reached the interview room, they asked me to introduce myself and then said, “Do you have anything to show us?”\nI opened my freshly made portfolio — and their reaction was priceless. They were shocked (in a good way 😄). They couldn’t believe I’d put that together so fast — and even more surprised that all of it was my own work.\nAfter that, they didn’t ask me the usual “Why do you want to join?” questions. Instead, they started asking what responsibilities I’d be ready to take on as a member.\n👑 The Big Surprise A few days later, the team list was out. I scrolled down to the Costume \u0026 Design Team section and froze for a second.\nThere it was —\nSharvin Tejasvi — Team Head. I was stunned. I didn’t expect that at all. A first-year student leading a team of six — including seniors! It felt surreal. But it also motivated me to prove that creativity, dedication, and quick thinking can make a difference, no matter your year.\n🎨 Designing the Panache Merch One of my first major tasks as team head was to design the Panache merch for the whole club. I had to make sure every member could proudly wear it with their name, team, and designation printed on it.\nAnd honestly? It turned out amazing. Seeing everyone wearing something I designed felt unreal — like all those small ideas in my head had finally come to life.\n🔥 The Shows Begin Then came the real action — the events!\n30th October – NIT Show: Our first big stage. It didn’t go as fire as we hoped, but it gave us experience and direction.\n31st October – Halloween Night: This one was lit! I designed 15 costumes with budget of 1000 Rs and I know myself how i pulled that of, made the accessories myself, and our team absolutely rocked the ramp walk. The best part? Our designs were featured in TimesNow Education’s blog! Seeing that was one of the proudest moments ever.\n6th November – WUD, Delhi: For this show, we refined our NIT designs, polished every detail, and made it shine — and it worked beautifully.\nEach show taught me something new — about teamwork, leadership, and how much effort goes into creating even a single outfit.\n✨ What I Learned From nervously applying with no experience to leading my own team and getting featured online — this journey with Panache has been unforgettable.\nIt taught me that creativity doesn’t need a resume — it needs courage, effort, and the will to keep creating.\nI’m super proud of what my team and I achieved, and I can’t wait to see where Panache takes us next.\n— Sharvin\n","wordCount":"635","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://szg-zone.github.io/DigitalGarden/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2025-11-08T07:04:37Z","dateModified":"2025-11-08T07:04:37Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sharvin Tejasvi"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://szg-zone.github.io/DigitalGarden/blogs/004-fashionevent/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"SZG Zone","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://szg-zone.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://szg-zone.github.io/DigitalGarden/ accesskey=h title="SZG Zone (Alt + H)">SZG Zone</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
