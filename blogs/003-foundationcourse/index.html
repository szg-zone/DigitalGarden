Today‚Äôs blog is about something exciting that kicked off with the start of our college ‚Äî our foundation course.\nThis course is designed to help us build essential skills like communication, professional growth, creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork. Students were divided into 20 groups of 10 each. I was placed in Team 11 and was chosen as the team head. Our team had 10 members, with 3 girls and 7 boys.\nIn the first class, we got to introduce ourselves and watched a video from the Dean of Liberal Arts. He spoke about trust, communication, management, media, creativity, problem-solving, and much more. I even noted down a small quote inspired by his words.\nüí° Coming Up With Our Project Idea Later, we had a group discussion about what skills each of us already had ‚Äî some knew Python, some were into stocks, some into creative fields, and so on. From there, we had to decide on a project.\nOur idea? A student-to-student learning platform exclusively for Bennett students. The motive isn‚Äôt money ‚Äî it‚Äôs education, collaboration, and building a strong community among us freshers.\nüåê The Platform Concept Here‚Äôs how it would work:\nEvery student creates a profile with their name, age, year, specialization (like B.Tech, Design, Ethical Hacking, etc.), and one skill they want to share.\nWhen you join, you get some starter coins (say, 100).\nStudents act both as learners and teachers.\nIf I want to learn drawing, I can spend 5 coins to book a class with someone skilled in drawing.\nThe ‚Äúteacher‚Äù earns 10 coins for teaching.\nThis creates a barter-like system where skills are exchanged for coins.\nBut we also noticed a flaw ‚Äî what if someone runs out of coins and feels demotivated? To fix this, we added:\nDaily quests (login rewards, completing classes to earn more coins)\nCampus collaborations (earn enough coins and exchange them for discounts or coupons at campus shops/food outlets)\nThis way, the system stays engaging and rewarding.\nüó£Ô∏è Faculty Feedback At first, some of us thought the foundation course wasn‚Äôt that important. But when I (along with my teammate Kanishka, who has now become a good friend) discussed our project idea with our teacher, she encouraged us to take it further.\nShe suggested we meet the Dean of Liberal Arts directly. And so, we did.\nMeeting him was a great experience ‚Äî he was super chill, full of good vibes, and genuinely interested in our idea. He even said that if we prepare a draft, he could arrange a proper meeting by Saturday. He also shared about other initiatives he‚Äôs working on, like designing a strategy-based game (similar to checkers) and mentoring kids writing books about the history of social media.\n‚ú® What‚Äôs Next? So, now the ball‚Äôs in our court. We‚Äôll be drafting our project idea properly and taking it forward. Honestly, I‚Äôm excited about where this could go. Even if it‚Äôs just a foundation course assignment, it feels like the start of something bigger.\nLet‚Äôs see how this journey unfolds ‚Äî and I‚Äôll keep updating you all here!\n‚Äî Sharvin\n","wordCount":"525","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://szg-zone.github.io/DigitalGarden/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2025-08-28T11:21:18Z","dateModified":"2025-08-28T11:21:18Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sharvin Tejasvi"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://szg-zone.github.io/DigitalGarden/blogs/003-foundationcourse/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"SZG Zone","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://szg-zone.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://szg-zone.github.io/DigitalGarden/ accesskey=h title="SZG Zone (Alt + H)">SZG Zone</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
