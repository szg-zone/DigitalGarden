      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-foundation-course-journey--our-first-project-idea&#34;&gt;🌟 Foundation Course Journey &amp;amp; Our First Project Idea&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, Sharvin here! Today’s blog is about something exciting that kicked off with the start of our college — our foundation course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This course is designed to help us build essential skills like communication, professional growth, creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork. Students were divided into 20 groups of 10 each. I was placed in Team 11 and was chosen as the team head. Our team had 10 members, with 3 girls and 7 boys.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
